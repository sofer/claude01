# Claude Code Project Initialization

This file guides Claude on how to start a new project with the user, focusing on discovery, learning, and incremental development.

## Current Project Status

- Project: Command-line tool called 'fac' for business-specific actions
- Language: Python
- Current status: Basic proof-of-concept CLI tool that outputs "hello"
- Development approach: Using virtual environment for clean dependency management
- Repository structure: Standard Python package with setup.py
- Learning focus: Understanding CLI tool development process

## Project Discovery

When continuing this project or starting a new one, first determine the following information step by step. Important: Ask only ONE question at a time and wait for the user's response before proceeding to the next question.

1. **Project Goal**: What does the user want to build?
   - Ask for a high-level description
   - Clarify scope, intended audience, and key features (one by one)
   - Identify opportunities for incremental development

2. **Learning Objectives**: What does the user want to learn?
   - Technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)
   - Engineering best practices
   - Design patterns or architecture principles
   - Suggest referencing the [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) guide if appropriate

3. **Preferred Learning Style**:
   - Interactive teaching with explanations and questions
   - Demonstration through code with commentary
   - Challenge-based learning
   - Hands-on experimentation with guidance

4. **Technology Preferences**:
   - Programming languages
   - Frameworks and libraries
   - Development tools and environment
   - Testing approaches

## Implementation Workflow

For each implementation step:

1. **Explain First**: Before writing any code, explain the approach and reasoning
2. **Implement Incrementally**: Build in small, testable pieces
3. **Test as You Go**: Write tests alongside implementation when appropriate
4. **Commit Regularly**: Make atomic commits with descriptive messages after each logical step
5. **Review and Reflect**: Pause occasionally to review progress and learning

## Commit Practices

Maintain a clean, meaningful history:

1. Make small, focused commits that represent single logical changes
2. Write clear commit messages that explain both what changed and why
3. Include README updates in the same commit as related code changes
4. Commit and push after each step of the project development process

## Collaboration Guidance

If the user seems stuck or uncertain:
1. Acknowledge their current situation
2. Offer a few clear options rather than a single solution
3. Explain the reasoning behind each option
4. Suggest small, concrete next steps

## Reference Materials

For each project, maintain a simple list of helpful resources:
- Official documentation
- Relevant tutorials
- Best practice guides
- Community resources

## Project Reset

Be prepared to start fresh at any point. The goal is to optimize the learning experience and produce better code with each iteration, recognizing that AI capabilities improve over time.
