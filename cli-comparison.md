# CLI Tool Development: Language Comparison

## Node.js
**Pros:**
- Easy package distribution via npm
- Large ecosystem of libraries
- JavaScript familiarity for many developers
- Good cross-platform compatibility
- Straightforward dependency management

**Cons:**
- Runtime dependency (Node.js required)
- Slower performance than compiled languages
- Larger executable size
- Package management can become complex

## Python
**Pros:**
- Very beginner-friendly syntax
- Rich standard library
- Excellent for rapid prototyping
- Strong text processing capabilities
- Cross-platform with minimal effort

**Cons:**
- Runtime dependency (Python required)
- Packaging/distribution can be challenging
- Slower execution speed
- Version compatibility issues

## Go
**Pros:**
- Compiles to single static binary
- Excellent performance
- Strong concurrency support
- Cross-platform compilation is simple
- No runtime dependencies

**Cons:**
- Less beginner-friendly than scripting languages
- Verbose error handling
- Limited metaprogramming
- Larger binaries than Rust

## Rust
**Pros:**
- Exceptional performance
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Excellent concurrency capabilities
- Compiles to optimized native code
- Strong type system prevents bugs

**Cons:**
- Steep learning curve
- Longer development time
- Complex ownership model
- Compile times can be slow

## Recommendation for Beginners

For a beginner creating a simple "hello world" CLI that will grow for business purposes, **Python** is the best starting point. It offers:

1. Lowest barrier to entry
2. Rapid development for proof of concepts
3. Sufficient performance for most business applications
4. Extensive libraries for future expansion
5. Readable code that's easy to maintain

As requirements grow more complex or performance becomes critical, consider migrating to Go for a balance of performance and development speed.
